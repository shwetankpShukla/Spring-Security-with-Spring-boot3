# Spring-Security-using-SpringBoot-3.0
Microservice Architecture. We will be implementing different libraries and techniques to implement a complete architecture.

Minimal Spring Boot sample app.

# Requirements
For building and running the application you need:

JDK 17
Maven 3
postgresql
Spring Security
JWT Token
Running the application locally
There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the main method in the

om.sp.security.SpringSecurityWithJwtTokenApplication
class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the Spring Boot Maven plugin like so:

mvn spring-boot:run
java -jar zipkin.jar
Port : 8080
